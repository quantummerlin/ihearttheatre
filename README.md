## Best Practices

### **DO:**
* Use one agent at a time (focused expertise)
* Reference the specific agent file
* Provide context about what you're working on
* Ask for specific outputs (not general advice)

### **DON'T:**
* Activate multiple agents at once (they'll blur)
* Skip the context (agents need to know what they're reviewing)
* Ignore the constraints (each agent has specific rules)
* Expect legal advice from the Compliance agent (consult a lawyer)
