The opening night of A Christmas Carol at Melbourne’s Comedy Theatre delivered a visually and emotionally charged experience, delightfully blending theatrical innovation with Dickens’ timeless message of redemption. This Old Vic production, conceived & directed by Matthew Warchus, stands out for its immersive atmosphere and meticulous attention to detail, taking the audience on a haunting journey and leaving an indelible impression.
The set & costume design by Rob Howell was nothing short of extraordinary, transforming the stage into a Dickensian dreamscape. A cascading expanse of lanterns from the stage into the auditorium, created a magical, almost ethereal ambiance, personifying hope and illumination in the face of Scrooge’s dim inner world.

The lighting design by Hugh Vanstone added another layer of depth, with cooler contrasts reflecting weather shifts and snow falling gracefully throughout the performance, enhancing the feeling of a crisp Victorian winter. The use of the warm lighting and mist contrasting with cool tones, created portals to transport the audience aesthetically between past, present, and future. This was particularly effective in the haunting scenes with Marley’s ghost, where the interplay of shadows and light added to the sense of foreboding.
The set operated like an intricate geometric jigsaw puzzle; its pieces shifted by the cast & slotted seamlessly, to creatively construct or deconstruct each setting. A gloss coffin amongst the dark, matte palette in scenes foreshadowing Scrooge’s fate evoked a somber & chilling effect, contrasting sharply to the vibrant, joyous smorgasbord in the course of transformation.
Musicians were elegantly positioned on the balcony & cast members also appeared in multiple positions throughout the wings & side doors, to evoke an enchanting & multidimensional soundscape, immersing the audience further into the world of Dickens. The timing of the sound effects & miming flawlessly depicted transitions & remarkably underscores the production’s precision & polished craft. All the props were so thoughtfully integrated, from the lanterns to hand-held bells and even smaller floor details that subtly conveyed peripheral themes. The use of doorframes added an unexpected dynamic, contributing to the feeling of Scrooge’s memories and ghosts materialising from all directions.
Eric Thomson’s portrayal of Scrooge is both captivating and heart-wrenching. His transformation felt earned, making the audience’s emotional investment in his journey palpable, with moments of sheer joy and sorrow deeply resonant. The entire cast delivered stellar performances, bringing warmth and enthusiasm to every scene. The audience’s emotional engagement was undeniable, as sobs were heard during key moments and tears of joy accompanied the production’s uplifting conclusion.
The combination of Dickens’ poignant narrative and Warchus’ conception, creates a deeply moving experience, reminding viewers of the magic of compassion and the true spirit of Christmas. Christopher Nightingale’s score blended fluently with traditional carols, heightening the emotional stakes while the handbell sequences and live music onstage augmented an exquisite auditory experience.
This production of A Christmas Carol is a masterful, multi-sensory journey. From mince pies & mandarins, to haunting misty portals and all the wonderful elements designed to immerse and move the audience. Embark on this joyous, exhilarating, and deeply emotional journey, as it captures the magic of Christmas and the transformative power of empathy. A theatrical triumph that blesses each and every one with the true spirit of Christmas.
