At the centre of ADMINISTRATION is Adeline Close, who confidently shares an interesting, sometimes uncomfortable and relatable story. The performance is both brave and vulnerable, painting a vivid personal picture of childhood and offering the audience reflections relating to the belief systems that have shaped us all.
The extremely intimate theatre setting added to the show’s charm, helping the audience to feel like a part of the story as it unfolds. Adeline delivered a captivating performance and the show flowed seamlessly despite a minor lighting hiccup at the start, which intriguingly drew the audience in. The interactions with Adeline’s prerecorded peers were perfectly timed throughout, adding extra layers, characters & tones to the storytelling.
Retro themes, such as uniforms, music and a time capsule, brought a nostalgic touch to the performance. The repetitive thoughts and organisation themes were cleverly woven into the narrative, emphasising Adeline’s struggles & triumphs, highlighting the consequences of children being excluded from important conversations.
The show also touched on heavier topics such as grief, blame, and fat shaming, handled with heartfelt sensitivity and honesty. Adeline’s confessionals were raw and real, leaving the audience both horrified and exhilarated. The thunderous applause at the end was a testament to the powerful storytelling and emotional impact of the performance.
Overall, “Administration” was an enjoyable watch that perfectly captures the essence of Melbourne’s Fringe Festival whilst comically unpacking the closure of a lifetime of luggage, in Adeline’s world.
