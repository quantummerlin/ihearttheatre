An other-worldly atmosphere is set from the moment you’re admitted into the theatre. The performance seems to begin even before the audience finds their seats, with dancers moving strategically & intensely, yet subtly, amongst patrons as they enter the plush auditorium. This early engagement sets the tone for the rest of the show, drawing the audience into its unique world from the very start. What seems to be a random person, is chosen to sit on a gold throne, adding an unexpected and engaging twist. This interaction blurs the line between performer and spectator, making the audience feel like an integral part of the show.
As the glossy & reflective stage is unveiled, the artists deliver a raw, industrial edge to traditional circus acts that combine grace and danger, highlighting the performers’ mastery. Acrobatic bodies creating striking visual effects, while the acts become both beautiful and haunting, showcasing the stark beauty of the human form and their movements creating live art. Contortionists pushing the limits of physical flexibility and strength, showcasing extraordinary balance & physical abilities.
The show features dynamic dance sequences and moments of subtle comedy, adding layers of complexity and engagement. The artistic visionary direction of Mitch Jones emphasises stage craft and production design, creating an emotionally resonant and surreal experience. The show challenges mainstream cultural norms and invites the audience to find beauty in the unconventional and the unholy. Like all good art, Apocrypha remains open to interpretation, allowing each viewer to take away their own unique experience and meaning.
Composer & Sound Designer Bridget Chappell along with Lighting Designer Gina Gasgoine; create a warm ambiance with soft lighting and eerie sounds. Alternating sound effects between chair gripping string compositions, cymbals, gongs & electronic bouts, to create an immersive and hypnotic atmosphere.
The post-apocalyptic, rave style costuming & use of spikes, chains, and other props add to the show’s intensity and visual impact. The performance explores themes of desire, dark night of the soul, rebirth, torture, possession and domination, often leaving the audience afraid to laugh or clap due to the intensity of the scenes.
The use of contemporary dance, glitching effects and robotic movements adds a futuristic and surreal quality. The show features a mix of strength, grace and agility, with performers contorting, mimicking, and engaging in often synchronised & inter-folded sequences. The use of props like a gold chair, bluestone boulders, bright bold fruit and petals added to the visual richness.
It’s noted for its ability to linger in the minds of viewers long after the final curtain falls. The combination of elements creates a rich, multi-faceted experience that resonates on both an intellectual and emotional level.
Apocrypha is a must-see for fans of experimental and boundary-pushing performance art. Its unique blend of circus, theatre, and provocative themes makes it a highlight of the Melbourne Fringe Festival. The show’s ability to engage the audience from the moment they enter, combined with its stunning visual and physical feats, ensures it will be remembered. This “alt-circus” performance is running from October 11 to 19 at the Darebin Arts Centre.
