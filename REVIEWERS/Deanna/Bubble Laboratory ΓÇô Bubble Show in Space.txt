If you think you’ve seen every kind of bubble trick under the sun, Bubble Laboratory – Bubble Show in Space at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival is here to prove otherwise and in the most dazzling way possible.
This joyful, family-friendly spectacle blends science, art and pure wonder, creating a world where bubbles aren’t just soap and water, but vehicles for imagination and humour.
Dr. Bubble & Marshmallow wastes no time capturing their audience. Kids are immediately drawn into the action cheering, clapping and gasping with delight, while adults are just as likely to find themselves wide-eyed and grinning.
The show’s magic lies in its clever layering: underneath the chaos of bubble-blowing and clowning is a smart, artful presentation. Shimmering lights refract through soap spheres, metallic hues glisten on stage and bursts of neon turn the space into something between a spacey dream and a disco. Bubbles filled with smoke float like enchanted orbs, while glowing rings, foam and delicate fractal shapes show just how much possibility exists in a simple solution.
And then there’s the clowning. At the heart of the show is a performer whose charm is irresistible; chaos is carefully curated, comedic timing is spot on and there’s an infectious sense of joy in every gesture.
Unexpected puppetry, playful shadow work and even a few cheeky pop culture nods keep things moving with variety and surprise.
In short, Bubble Laboratory is a theatrical treat, 45 minutes of pure family joy – playful, beautiful and filled with wonder.
