There are few things more joyful than witnessing a troupe this wildly alive.
Circus Oz’s latest spectacle at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival is a full body, technicolour collision and a glorious rebellion against the mundane.
It’s a sweaty, sparkly fever dream stitched together with slapstick, a live music duo and raw, breath-stealing bounds. The show doesn’t ask for your attention; it demands it.
The ensemble is magnetic, hurling themselves (and each other) across the stage with an effortless grace that conceals the years of brutal training etched into every move.
There’s a visceral thrill in their physicality, a palpable sense of risk and joy pulsing through every sequence. A high-flying trapeze act brings the entire cast into the air, drawing gasps from the crowd with each mid-air pass.
The stakes feel emotional as much as physical, the kind of collective exhale that only comes when everyone’s holding their breath together.
Archery, bowling, dresses and flips — the absurdity is deliberate, the chaos carefully orchestrated. The comedy is muscular and unapologetically physical, every beat landing with precision. Their timing is flawless, their message unmistakable: play is power, and joy is resistance.
Moments unravel with the flair of a comic brawl with moving tables, scuffles and a choreography of near-misses and gleeful disorder. Slapstick and sport collide in a world where glitter is grit and the rough edges are where the magic lives.
They close in flight, the whole troupe swinging above the stage in a final act of shared rhythm and trust. A moment suspended in time — a sparkly, sweaty, symphonic exhale. It doesn’t just entertain; it uplifts.
