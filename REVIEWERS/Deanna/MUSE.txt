The NICA end of year showcase: ‘MUSE’ was an inspiring exploration, blending raw physicality with intimate vulnerability. Audiences were greeted with the invitation to take a rock and place it on the side of the stage as they enter the auditorium. This interactive element, combined with the “Muse Wall” where attendees could declare their muses, set the stage for a performance that invited personal reflection.

The rocks on stage, evoked the visual serenity of a Japanese dry landscape garden and were shifted to create a contrasting thunderous sound amongst a delicate balancing act, commanding the attention of the audience as the showcase began. After the first act the performers each collected a portion of rocks, quickly and effortlessly clearing the stage for the next, displaying the power of teamwork and many hands making light work.
Jesse Holden’s Hoop Diving opened with electric excitement, showcasing agility and precision. Each dive through the unconventional square construct felt like a dance with gravity, building to a crescendo of balancing and bouncing that left the audience on edge, yet exhilarated by the finesse.
Gabriel Jackson’s Chinese Pole became a vertical pathway between comfort and challenge, as Jackson’s movements conveyed both strength and vulnerability. A performance with a giant mattress, created the illusion of a bedroom where dreams and struggles collide. The addition of wind, piano, smoke, and shadows intensified the atmosphere, making each ascent and descent a battle between control and chaos.
The show’s transitions were seamless, with smooth setups continuing the theme of teamwork and projected images that added depth with a narrative. These interludes created a sense of continuity, allowing the audience to get to know each performer and their journey, transforming the production into a series of interconnected stories rather than isolated acts.
Rose Symons’ aerial straps routine was a haunting display of dramatic flexibility and contortion. Her performance felt almost otherworldly, with movements that defy human limits. There was a lingering sense of melancholy, as if she’s embodying the struggle of bending without breaking.
Gemma Jackson’s hula hoop act brought a playful yet intense energy. Her ability to maintain poise while performing with a hoop in her mouth and with sounds of a harmonica was captivating. As the routine sped up, a red light shifted the mood, creating a hypnotic, spectacle with the holographic hoops that mirrored the pulse of mood swings & creative urgency.
Taylor Vogt’s aerial rope routine was a masterclass in strength and grace. Weaving intricate knots and transforming the rope into an extension of their body, telling a story of resilience and artistry. The dance evokes Nordic themes, blending raw power with ethereal beauty.
Jasmin Tait’s surrender to the swinging trapeze, transported the audience to an Italian summer. With a red gingham costume resembling a tablecloth amongst a grape vine, her performance exuded nostalgia, fluidity, freedom and skill.
Anais Stewart’s aerial straps routine took a darker turn, with birds chirping interrupted by a gunshot. Her performance embodied strength and contortion, hanging from the straps in a way that suggested both flight and rigid tension, like a muse caught between freedom and rigor mortis.
Merlene Hutt’s Cyr wheel act was a visual marvel. The giant hoop, contrasted with red and blue tones, created a stark, dynamic visual. Her spins were hypnotic, each turn building until the sequence ended with an unexpected burst of playful dance.
Zaelea Nolte’s static trapeze performance brought a vintage aesthetic, her movements exploring themes of strength and vulnerability. Dropping into poses with precision, she demonstrated a comfort within discomfort.
Jasmine Poniris’ handstand act on a chair was a study in balance and fluidity. Her use of space was innovative, enhanced by strobe lighting and high-pitched keys that created an almost surreal atmosphere. Her control and poise were admirable.
Ty Wallant’s diabolo performance injected energy and innovation. The interplay of red, blue, yellow, white and LED lights transformed the traditional juggling act into a futuristic display, reminiscent of a Jedi wielding light and motion. His routine was of a playful yet intricate nature.
Luca Trimboli’s Straps routine introduced a softer, more introspective note. With a glitter physique in firm planks, followed by flexible rubber movements, and finally ripping petals from flowers. The floating petals became symbols of the delicate, transient nature of creative moments.
All showcased the light-hearted side of the creative process, and each performer shared in a final moment together that was a testament to the discipline, dedication, fragility, trust, and camaraderie they had cultivated over their years at NICA.
Muse, by the National Institute of Circus Arts, displayed a transformative experience. Each act built upon the last, offering glimpses into the multifaceted nature of inspiration. Through strength, vulnerability, and breathtaking skill, the performers remind us that the path to creativity is as challenging as it is beautiful. This production is more than a circus show—it is an ode to the human spirit’s relentless pursuit of artistry.
