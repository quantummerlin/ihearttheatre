Ruby Wax is a comedic force of nature and in “I’m Not As Well As I Thought I Was”, she delivers a performance that is as raw as it is exuberantly funny.
This one-woman show at The Comedy Theatre was an entirely engaging mix of stand-up, storytelling and self-reflection – part comedy, part catharsis. From the moment she stepped on stage, Wax captivated the audience with her razor-sharp wit and unfiltered honesty. She took us on a deeply personal journey through her mental health struggles, touching on everything from therapy to silent retreats and even swimming with humpback whales in a quest for inner peace.
Her ability to weave humour into these experiences is nothing short of masterful – one minute, the audience is roaring with laughter; the next, they’re holding their breath as she peels back the layers of her psyche. A highlight of the show is Wax’s uncanny knack for impersonation. Whether she’s embodying a peculiar retreat-goer, channelling a well-meaning therapist or even giving voice to a whale, her character work is sharp, hilarious and brimming with personality.
Wax shifts effortlessly between satire and sincerity, ensuring that even the heaviest moments are laced with lightheartedness. “I’m Not As Well As I Thought I Was” is more than just a comedy show – it’s an exploration of what it means to be human.
Wax doesn’t shy away from the raw, uncomfortable truths of mental illness, but she presents them with such warmth and relatability that the experience feels less like a performance and more like a shared moment of understanding.
Ultimately, this show is a testament to Ruby Wax’s enduring talent. With her signature sharpness and commanding stage presence, she delivers a performance that is both side-splittingly funny and profoundly moving – proving that even in life’s darkest moments, there’s always room for laughter.
