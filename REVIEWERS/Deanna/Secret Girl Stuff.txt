The play is a vivid portrayal of modern life, exhibiting contemporary elements such as selfies, vaping and emojis to reflect on today’s generation. It begins and ends with a strong feeling of sisterhood, bookending the narrative with a sense of unity and shared catharsis.
The storytelling presents multiple perspectives and overlapping dialogue, creating a tapestry of voices & characters that reflect the diverse stages of womanhood. Themes such as the first time, coming out, hysteria & a maiden’s fear in transitioning to mother, along with the journey of pregnancy are explored with raw honesty.
The play delves into the complex emotions of reflecting on one’s relationship with their mother, contrasting the kind of daughter one has been, with the kind of daughter one might have. One of the most poignant moments is the peace found in hearing one’s mother’s ache for connection, even when calls are avoided. This theme of generational connection and disconnection is interwoven throughout the narrative, highlighting the selfishness and synchronicity that can exist within family dynamics, along with realisations as parents, as we age.
The production does not shy away from difficult topics, addressing relationship breakdowns, the negative history of men, and the unnecessary pain inflicted by societal expectations. References to iconic moments in history and pop culture influences, add context, making the story both personal and universal.
The bare set, consisting of a bed, table, record, pillow, and disco ball, allows the actors’ body expressions to take center stage, emphasizing the raw and unfiltered nature of their performances. The use of the side door and entry corridor created a sense of shock and immediacy.
“Secret Girl Stuff” also educates its audience on critical issues such as rape schedules, the gravity of postpartum depression, and often-missed diagnosis. The inclusion of statistics underscores the real-world impact of these issues, grounding the emotional narrative in stark reality.
In summary, “Secret Girl Stuff” presented by Cats in the Cupboard Productions, is an enthusiastic and thought-provoking show that tackles the complexities of womanhood with grit. The themes are timely, and the execution is powerful.
