Truth storms into Melbourne’s iconic Malthouse Theatre with an uncompromising exploration of power, secrecy and the human collateral of exposing truth.
Directed with visionary precision & striking brilliance by Susie Dee, boldly interrogating the legacies of whistleblowers such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. The show confronts the audience with the uncomfortable realities hidden beneath our everyday narratives. From the get go, a heart pounding performance thrusts the audience into a realm where every secret reverberates like a whispered confession in a crowded room.
Patricia Cornelius’s latest script plunges its spectators into the stark reality of this world, where the manipulation of information is not merely a political tool but a deeply personal struggle. The production forces the audience to consider the real-life costs of silence versus the inherent risk assessment of exposure. Every line is delivered with an urgency, raw vulnerability and fierce determination to expose what many would prefer to keep hidden, only to be met with the heart wrenching silence of a privileged and distracted populace.
The theatre’s blend of contemporary design and historic charm not only grounds the production but elevates it, offering an intimate yet expansive layout that allows the stratified multimedia elements to unfold remarkably. Every element of the production is meticulously crafted to amplify its core themes. Matilda Woodroofe’s set and costume designs evoke a distinct, almost industrial aesthetic, representing the cold, calculated nature of modern surveillance and control. All punctuated by Paul Jackson’s dynamic lighting & sound by Kelly Ryall, which create an atmosphere that is both haunting and electrifying. The intermittent multimedia projections consolidate the traditional stage space, seamlessly blurring boundaries between live performance and digital narratives. These absolutely brilliant technological interludes serve as potent metaphors for the omnipresent reach of modern power in the digital age.
At the core of Truth is its cast, whose performances uphold the production into a living, breathing exploration of personal risk, collective defiance and ultimate bravery. Each performer inhabits multiple roles, offering nuanced perspectives that reveal the complex layers of the narrative: Emily Havea, Tomáš Kantor, James O’Connell, Eva Rees and Eva Seymour, deliver performances with emotional intensity drawing us deeper into each character’s inner turmoil between duty and the yearning for liberation. Together, these performers transform every whispered secret and bold declaration into a palpable experience, making the audience feel every risk, every moment of vulnerability and every surge of defiant energy.
Truth is more than a recounting of events; it is a searing reflection of the ethical imperatives of our age. It cultivates tension and introspection, urging the audience to question not only the forces that keep information hidden but also our own complicity in perpetuating systems of control. Yet, it is this very tension that propels the narrative, engaging viewers on both an intellectual and visceral level. The attention to detail is a testament to the team’s passion for igniting meaningful conversation through art, ensuring that every moment is felt deeply by all in attendance.
Ultimately, Truth contributes to the intention of its subjects; in an attempt to change the world, it compels us to confront uncomfortable realities and to question structures that thrive on concealment. For those who seek theatre that challenges as much as it inspires, Truth is a compelling experience and this production stands as a testament to the transformative power of the stage.
