‘Your Name Means Dream’ at Red Stitch Theatre is a captivating exploration of relationships between humans & machines, brought to life with remarkable depth and complexity.
Written by Oscar nominee and Obie Award-winning playwright José Rivera and directed by multiple Green Room Award and Matilda Award nominee, Kat Henry. This production features absolute standout performances by Caroline Lee and Lucy Ansell, who navigate the intricate dynamics of their characters with admirable grace and precision.
The play centers on Aislin (Caroline Lee), a woman approaching her last chapter, living a tattered life in an apartment with dirty windows, portraying her isolation and decay of a once vibrant life. Aislin’s son introduces her to Stacy (Lucy Ansell), a humanoid robot designed to provide companionship and support. The narrative delves into key concepts of existentialist thought such as crises, angst, courage, freedom, immanence and the evolving role of Artificial Intelligence in our everyday lives.

Caroline Lee embodies a character who is stubborn and rigid, yet eventually transforms thanks to Stacy, into someone capable of fluid and fun moments. Lee’s portrayal captures the essence of a woman sinking into her aging process, reflecting a lucid appreciation from youth to her current state. Her interactions with Stacy are painstakingly emotional, making the audience lose their breath in the presence of her poise.
Lucy Ansell starts with a stiff & glitchy, robotic demeanour that gradually learns to become more palatably human-like. Ansell’s ability to balance the mechanical and human aspects of Stacy, while arbitrarily imitating others, reveals glimpses of her triple threat talents & contributes layers of intricacy. Her mannerisms highlight the play’s exploration of possession and one’s loss of identity.
Kat Henry’s direction ensures that every entrance and exit is meaningful & instrumental to the overall narrative. The use of the New York accent adds authenticity to the characters and their backgrounds. The tones of the performances range from humorous to harrowing, creating a rich tapestry of emotions. The lighting design by Amelia Lever-Davidson enhances each moment, using shadows and light to amplify the characters’ emotional states beyond the stage. The immersive sound design by Ian Moorhead, further enables the audience to absorb the story.
The sets by Hahnie Goldfinch, feature a worn leather couch, an aged throw, peeling wallpaper, and dirty windows. These elements create a tangible sense of Aislin’s world. The inclusion of a vinyl record player & bulky speaker adds to the atmosphere, evoking a sense of nostalgia and the passage of time.
“Your Name Means Dream” is a sign of our times, addressing contemporary issues with a blend of humor, tension, and existential inquiry. The play’s harrowing finale leaves a lasting impact, prompting audiences to reflect on the future of caregiving and the nature of human connection.
This production deserves a bigger stage; however, the intimacy of this theatre experience allows the essence of the human experience to be received with exceptional power and clarity, making it a privilege to be in the room. Make sure to reserve yourself a seat to this show running until the 24th of November.
