I went to see “Imagine Live” at the Geelong Arts Centre, and it was fantastic!
First of all, there were so many punny jokes that made everyone laugh. The show was delightfully charming and I loved how interactive it was.
The clever use of props made it all come alive, and the sound effects done live on stage were astounding. Halfway through I was wondering, “How long is this show?” because I didn’t want it to end! 
The stage was lit up with ambient neon lights, and the music from the keyboards and violin were mystical. The whole show was full of wonder, and all the kids, including me, were screeching answers with joy.
“Imagine Live” is based on the book Imagine by Alison Lester. The book is all about using your imagination to explore different places and animals. It was like the book came to life right before our eyes.
Congratulations to the super talented team:
    • Writer/Director/Designer: Jolyon James
    • Composer: Nate Gilkes
    • Performer/Assistant Director: Ashlea Pyke
    • Performer/Digital Puppeteer: Phillip McInnes
    • Performer: Aubrey Flood
If you get a chance to see “Imagine Live,” you should definitely go. It’s a show you’ll always remember & it will almost certainly make you want to leave with a copy of the book!
Imagine Live was only on for the weekend in Geelong, but will be touring Australia in 2025.  For more information check out their website.
